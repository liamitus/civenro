# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Civenro (Frontend)

**Civenro** is a community-driven platform that enhances transparency and civic engagement in the legislative process. This repository now contains only the **frontend** code, providing the user interface and client-side logic. The backend code and data fetching logic have been moved to a separate repository, ensuring clear separation of concerns and easier independent development.
